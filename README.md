# Process of Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA) Threat Model Worksheet

## Project Overview
In this project, I practiced using the Process of Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA) threat model framework. I determined whether a new shopping app is safe to launch.

## Scenario
I’m part of the growing security team at a company for sneaker enthusiasts and collectors. The business is preparing to launch a mobile app that makes it easy for their customers to buy and sell shoes. I’m performing a threat model of the application using the PASTA framework.

## Actions Taken
I went through each of the seven stages of the PASTA framework to identify security requirements for the new sneaker company app.

## I. Define Business and Security Objectives
### Business Requirements:
- Users can create member profiles internally or by connecting external accounts.
- The app must process financial transactions.
- The app should be in compliance with PCI-DSS.

## II. Define the Technical Scope
### Technologies Used:
- Application Programming Interface (API)
- Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
- Advanced Encryption System (AES)
- SHA-256
- SQL

**APIs** facilitate data exchange between customers, partners, and employees. They handle sensitive data and connect various users and systems, making them a high priority. However, identifying the specific APIs in use is essential before prioritizing security measures. APIs often have a larger attack surface and can be prone to vulnerabilities.

## IV. Threat Analysis
### Two Types of Threats:
- **Injection Attacks**
- **Session Hijacking**

## V. Vulnerability Analysis
### Two Vulnerabilities That Could Be Exploited:
- **Lack of Prepared Statements**
- **Broken API Token**

## VI. Attack Modeling
_(This section is missing details. Please provide more information.)_

## VII. Risk Analysis and Impact
### Security Controls to Reduce Risk:
1. **SHA-256**
2. **Incident Response Procedures**
3. **Password Policy**
4. **Principle of Least Privilege**
